          <p>Google Docs and email do not work well for remotely teaching code. They don't preserve whitespace, the fonts aren't monospaced, the spell check gets in the way, etc. Paste bins are better, but they are too static if you're looking for real time teaching. 
		W2C is what you need - a good editor and real-time collaboration with your professor.</p>

          <p>	W2C focus on teaching students how to code instead of just troubleshooting their development machines.  Forget fiddling around with clunkier tools like boring online courses, Skype, screen sharing - just teach using W2C.
		W2C is the easiest way to teach code quickly live to your students, with built in video and voice chat, student's feel right in the classroom teaching. </p>

          <p> Why cannot I use Google Docs? Google Docs wasn't made for this. It doesn't have the seamless interview question switching. It doesn't do indentation properly or have syntax highlighting. You'll also miss out on Coding Hire's rating/feedback mechanism, built in timer,  interview playback and everything else you need to properly analyze the interviewee.W^2C is the easiest way to teach code quickly live to your students, with built in video & voice chat, student's feel right in the classroom teaching. </p>
